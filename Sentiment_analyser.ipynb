       " 'Lively atmosphere with nice Indian music playing on a decent sound system.  Nice staff and good service.  Food was good and freshly prepared.  Samosas had way too much chili flakes.  I like them with spice but not loads of chili flakes.  Tandori chicken was tasty though hotter in terms of spice than I am used too.  I recommend trying this place especially if you like hot and spicy food.',\n",
       " \"My new favorite Indian place in the area by a wide margin.  I'm still a fan some dishes elsewhere (best veggie samosas: Mehek, best naan: Masala Grill), but overall, this place blows the other guys away.  All of the chicken entrees I've tried have been outstanding, including tikka masala, korma, and cashmere.  The grilled chicken appetizer with onions and peppers (can't recall the name) was amazing. Can't comment on the service or atmosphere, as all but one of my experiences have been take-out, but everyone seems quite friendly, and they have done a good job with the space (which wasn't all that great to begin with). I would probably award 4.5 stars if I could, because the naan is just a tad dry and lacks the chewy, moist center underneath the crisp crust that I like.  Also, the samosas are very good, but I think they are a bit heavy on the spices.  I also got the chicken soup once because I had a cold and needed a backup in case I couldn't stomach the normal fare that the rest of my family wanted.  I suppose it's what you get for ordering chicken soup at an Indian place.\",\n",
       " 'We went to Cross Culture Princeton for dinner and the food was amazingly tasty, I have tried other Indian restaurants in the area but there is no comparison in the taste. The service was outstanding in warm cozy and romantic atmosphere with classical music in the background. We had sizzling Chicken and Lamb kebab for appetizer. We enjoyed the vegetarian and non-vegetarian entree with fresh Tandoori Naan bread and basmati rice. We highly recommend this place to everyone.',\n",

I love Indian food, and have not been able to find a local Indian restaurant that I really like until now. The lamb biryani was delicious, as was the Tandoori chicken. Very excited about this place - the restaurant is well appointed, lighting is subdued and the booths are cozy. The service and food are both excellent. And as a bonus, it's BYO.\",\n",
       " 'Just had a wonderful evening at this five-month-old find.  Mixed grill was generous, delicious, and as well prepared as it was sizzling when it arrived at the table.  Great samosas, Nan bread, and superb eggplant dish.  The service was extremely professional and friendly at the same time.  This is the best, most relaxing spot for Indian cuisine in the Princeton area.  Mmmm.',\n",

Cross Culture is apparently a new addition to the Princeton Shopping Center, and I'm super excited about this discovery.  They make some of the best Indian food I've had in awhile.  I went with my family for a pre-Christmas dinner.  There were five of us, so we tried a bunch of different items.  From the appetizer menu: chicken samosas, harabhara kabab, and the panir tikka (OMG amazing!).  For entrees we had: chicken korma (one of my all-time favorites, excellently done), lamb curry, tandoori chicken, bhindi masala (awesome okra dish).  All of it was super yummy and I can't wait to go back!\",\n",

Having moved here from the mecca of Indian food, Edison, I was a bit sceptical that this would be an authentic experience.  Was I ever wrong!  This is delicious, fresh Indian cuisine, spiced just right.  We had chicken biryani; the meat was tender and aromatic.  Shrimp karahi was equally delicious, served in a spicy tomato sauce, perfect with basmati rice.  Most restaurants charge for raita but here it was included with our breat order, garlic naan.  Service was informative and prompt, yet we were not rushed.  I give this place a major thumbs up and recommend that  you try it.',\n",
       " 'Yum yum yum\\r\\nSeriously the most refined Indian cuisine I\\'ve had since Manhattan. Multilayered flavours that devote more to artistry than merely heat and garam masala from a jar  (the Indian version of \"Italian seasoning\"); here, each dish has its own distinctive flavor and texture, and idiots like me want to start learning which breads are supposed to accompany which dishes, instead of the usual any bread with any dish simply because we don\\'t know any better. Yes, it\\'s that good.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe had the mixed grill tandoori, lamb saag, pickles, eggplant, the best okra I\\'ve ever had (even later, reheated for breakfast).\\r\\n\\r\\nThere were four of us splitting everything, so I missed what I was told was incredible fish and shrimp from the mixed grill. The chicken was tender, spiced well, and what one wants from a good tandoori. The only doozy was the lamb, which, as tender and juicy as it was, had that livery tinge from steaming.\\r\\n\\r\\nOkra--oh my God good. Or Gods, as it might be. Again tender, separate pieces that were neither tough nor greasy. If you haven\\'t ever had good okra, please try it here (or at a really Southern place fried or stewed with tomatoes). There was texture, the seeds were tender, no woodiness at all. The saag was fine, as in fine dining, finely minced spinach that doesn\\'t get stuck in your teeth and has a layered set of spices that doesn\\'t just burn your mouth or turn your lips yellow. Sublime. I can almost dismiss my desire for heat because the flavours were so good.',\n",
       " \"We had a really good dinner at Cross Cultures.  The restaurant serves food that is both traditional and authentic, yet it's a bit more refined than your typical Indian restaurant.  Our entrees were tasty and prepared with the amount of heat we requested.  The dining area is spotless and tastefully decorated, providing for nice ambiance.  The service was both attentive and friendly. We'll definitely return.\",\n",
       " \"Excellent quality and ambiance. Indian food in Princeton varies a lot and it's difficult to find a consistent experience, even at one restaurant. I hesitate to give a huge, glowing review based on one visit, but if the second visit is anything like the first, I'll go to 5 stars. I had the Cashmere Chicken and my bf had the Chicken Vindaloo and it was all extremely tasty. Pleasant, attentive staff. Loved it!\",\n",
       " \"I'd give this place 4 stars despite the food (though it's delicious).  A clean, well-decorated Indian restaurant is all too rare, at least in my experience.  One with great service is unheard of.  \\r\\nWhile being Indian grants me familiarity with most menu items, I'm used to the staff being of zero help in helping to describe or navigate the menu.  The people here however were happily willing to give advice on everything.\",\n",

The service was excellent with attentive and friendly staff.  We walked out happy and full!',\n",

We enjoyed the vegetarian and non-vegetarian entree with fresh Tandoori Naan bread and basmati rice. We highly recommend this place to everyone.'"
